Note that the KV cache of one token depends on all its previous tokens. This means that the KV cache of the same token appearing at different positions in a sequence will be different. Given a request prompt, the generation computation in the LLM service can be decomposed into two phases: The prompt phase takes the whole user prompt (\ud835\udc651, . . . ,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b) as input and computes the probability of the first new to- ken \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 | \ud835\udc651, . . . ,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b).

Because the requests share the same model weights, the overhead of moving weights is amortized across the requests in a batch, and can be over- whelmed by the computational overhead when the batch size is sufficiently large. However, batching the requests to an LLM service is non-trivial for two reasons. First, the requests may arrive at different times. A naive batching strat- egy would either make earlier requests wait for later ones or delay the incoming requests until earlier ones finish, lead- ing to significant queueing delays.

To address this problem, fine-grained batching mecha- nisms, such as cellular batching [16] and iteration-level sched- uling [60], have been proposed. Unlike traditional methods that work at the request level, these techniques operate at the iteration level. After each iteration, completed requests are removed from the batch, and new ones are added. There- fore, a new request can be processed after waiting for a single iteration, not waiting for the entire batch to complete. Moreover, with special GPU kernels, these techniques elim- inate the need to pad the inputs and outputs. By reducing the queueing delay and the inefficiencies from padding, the fine-grained batching mechanisms significantly increase the throughput of LLM serving. 3  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth <eos> <resv> \u2026 <resv> You only live once <eos> <resv> \u2026 <resv> 2038 slots never used (internal fragmentation) 2 slots future used (reserved) External\""}, {"x": 0.7123884558677673, "y": -5.886118412017822, "text": "[Page no. 4] \"fragmentation 7 KV cache states for request A\u2019s prompt 3 KV cache states for request B\u2019s prompt 1 slot future used (reserved) 507 slots never used (Internal fragmentation) Request B current iteration Request A current iteration 1 slot for generated token Figure 3.

Since OPT can generate sequences up to 2048 tokens, the memory required to store the KV cache of one request can be as much as 1.6 GB. Concurrent GPUs have memory capacities in the tens of GBs.

Scheduling for unknown input & output lengths. The requests to an LLM service exhibit variability in their input and output lengths. This requires the memory management system to accommodate a wide range of prompt lengths. In addition, as the output length of a request grows at decoding, the memory required for its KV cache also expands and may exhaust available memory for incoming requests or ongoing generation for existing prompts.

Specifically, the attention operator is split on the attention head dimension, each SPMD process takes care of a subset of attention heads in multi-head attention. We observe that even with model parallel execution, each model shard still processes the same set of input tokens, thus requiring the KV Cache for the same positions. Therefore, vLLM features a single KV cache manager within the cen- tralized scheduler, as in Fig. 4. Different GPU workers share the manager, as well as the mapping from logical blocks to physical blocks. This common mapping allows GPU workers to execute the model with the physical blocks provided by the scheduler for each input request.

During execution, the GPU workers synchronize the intermediate results with the all-reduce communication primitive without the coordination of the scheduler, as in [47]. In the end, the GPU workers send the sampled tokens of this iteration back to the scheduler.

This is because small block sizes often result in numerous small data transfers between CPU and GPU, which limits the effective PCIe bandwidth.

The idea of virtual memory and paging is effective for managing the KV cache in LLM serving because the workload requires dynamic memory allocation (since the output length is not known a priori) and its perfor- mance is bound by the GPU memory capacity. However, this does not generally hold for every GPU workload. For exam- ple, in DNN training, the tensor shapes are typically static, and thus memory allocation can be optimized ahead of time. For another example, in serving DNNs that are not LLMs, an increase in memory efficiency may not result in any per- formance improvement since the performance is primarily\""}, {"x": 1.0995001792907715, "y": -7.689444541931152, "text": "[Page no. 13] \"compute-bound. In such scenarios, introducing the vLLM\u2019s techniques may rather degrade the performance due to the extra overhead of memory indirection and non-contiguous block memory. However, we would be excited to see vLLM\u2019s techniques being applied to other workloads with similar properties to LLM serving. LLM-specific optimizations in applying virtual mem- ory and paging. vLLM re-interprets and augments the idea of virtual memory and paging by leveraging the application- specific semantics. One example is vLLM\u2019s all-or-nothing swap-out policy, which exploits the fact that processing a request requires all of its corresponding token states to be stored in GPU memory. Another example is the recomputa- tion method to recover the evicted blocks, which is not feasi- ble in OS. Besides, vLLM mitigates the overhead of memory indirection in paging by fusing the GPU kernels for memory access operations with those for other operations such as attention. 9 Related Work General model\""}, {"x": 1.2263015508651733, "y": -0.5069507956504822, "text": "[Page no. 13] \"serving systems.

Swapping [23, 42, 55], recomputation [7, 24] and their combination [40] have been utilized to reduce the peak memory of training. Notably, FlexGen [46] studies how to swap weights and token states for LLM inference with 13  limited GPU memory, but it does not target the online serv- ing settings. OLLA [48] optimizes the lifetime and location of tensors to reduce fragmentation, but it does not do fine- grained block-level management or online serving. FlashAt- tention [13] applies tiling and kernel optimizations to reduce the peak memory of attention computation and reduce I/O costs. This paper introduces a new idea of block-level mem- ory management in the context of online serving. 10 Conclusion This paper proposes PagedAttention, a new attention algo- rithm that allows attention keys and\""}, {"x": -0.7073121666908264, "y": -7.803776264190674, "text": "[Page no. 14] \"values to be stored in non-contiguous paged memory, and presents vLLM, a high-throughput LLM serving system with efficient mem- ory management enabled by PagedAttention. Inspired by operating systems, we demonstrate how established tech- niques, such as virtual memory and copy-on-write, can be adapted to efficiently manage KV cache and handle various decoding algorithms in LLM serving. Our experiments show that vLLM achieves 2-4\u00d7 throughput improvements over the state-of-the-art systems.
