2,1077,60,Some major design flaws,"I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c",3,0,0,General,Dresses,Dresses

5,1080,49,Not for the very petite,"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.",2,0,4,General,Dresses,Dresses

9,1077,34,Such a fun dress!,"I'm 5""5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.",5,1,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
10,1077,53,Dress looks like it's made of cheap material,Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,3,0,14,General,Dresses,Dresses

12,1095,53,Perfect!!!,"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid",5,1,2,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
13,767,44,Runs big,"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees.",5,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Intimates
14,1077,50,Pretty party dress with some issues,This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,3,1,1,General,Dresses,Dresses

22,1077,31,Not what it looks like,"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

26,949,33,Huge disappointment,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,2,0,0,General,Tops,Sweaters

29,4,28,Great layering piece,"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Sweaters

154,829,44,Great colors but....,"I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.",3,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
155,829,48,Beautiful colors,This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.,5,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
156,1008,37,,"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.",5,1,1,General,Bottoms,Skirts
157,523,43,Australian sizing!!,So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.,3,0,2,Initmates,Intimate,Swim
158,829,53,,I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did !,4,1,7,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
159,829,33,Vibrant metallic,"This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .",4,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
160,1126,39,So sad not mine,"Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.",4,1,0,General,Jackets,Outerwear
161,829,52,"Scratchy, uncomfortable top","The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.
